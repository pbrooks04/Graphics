**********************
*   CURRENT STATUS   *
**********************

The currently implemented scene consists of two planes, a 
cylinder and a “glass” ellipsoid. Rays are recursively 
traced up to 4 times and each pixel is divided into a 
3x3 grid with a ray being sent in a random section of 
each segment. Rays which hit the ellipsoid are refracted 
and others are reflected. Environment mapping is 
partially implemented. It loads an image but fails to 
read from colour buffers due to seg fault errors that 
occur after some time. Values are attempted by indexing 
as in the 
"Image struct setColorAtPixel(int i, int j, Color& col)" 
by using an index of [x*width+y] for each buffer. x  
and y values are bounded by 0 and image width-1 or 
height-1 respectively. Index origins are defined assuming 
that the origin of the image (0,0) is at the top left 
corner. Region origins are set to be the bottom left 
pixel of a face, therefore the y direction value (v) 
is subtracted.

**********************
*   FILE STRUCTURE   *
**********************

The structure is pretty much the same as in the starter 
code. Implementations were written were hinted within 
the starter code comments and helper methods were created 
to keep things clean.
